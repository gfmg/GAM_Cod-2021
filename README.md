# Spatiotemporal-Cod üêü

This repository contains the R code used to implement the analysis and develop the figures included in the [manuscript](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016578362100182X): 

> "Gonzalez, G.M., Wiff, R., Marshall C.T., Cornulier, T. 2021. Estimating spatio-temporal distribution of fish and gear selectivity functions from pooled scientific survey and commercial fishing data"  

As a guide: 
* Files starting with "M", includes scripts related with the Model implementation.
* Files starting with "F", includes scripts containing the development of the Figures incldued in the manuscript.
* Files starting with "S" includes scripts containing the work included in the Supplementary materials.

Several of the scripts are still under development and will be included shortly.

### Pairwise plots of gear spatio-temporal overlaps (selected examples)

Calculated spatio-temporal volumes around the data for four pairs of gears, including the IBTS survey (‚ÄúGOV‚Äù). Hypervolumes are materialized by random points within each hypervolume (raw data not shown). 

The 3 axes are: 
* scaled latitude (‚ÄúShootLat.sc‚Äù); 
* scaled longitude (‚ÄúShootLon.sc‚Äù) 
* scaled time of year (‚ÄúJ.day.sc‚Äù).
